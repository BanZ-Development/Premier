            <h1>Right Insurance For The Job</h1>
            <span></span>
            <p>Premier has the right kinds of insurance with the right providers and in the right amounts.  This is an extremely important topic and one that is often not as well understood as it should be.  As a traffic manager, you need to be most concerned with cargo insurance, the policy that will repair or replace your product should it be damaged in transit.  One unpaid claim can cost you a lot more than you save by using underinsured carriers or brokers.  This section will touch upon various insurance issues, starting with cargo insurance. And be sure to check out the terms and frequently asked questions below for more information.</p>
            <h1>Cargo Insurance</h1>
            <p>Premier carries one million dollars of “all-risk” coverage with an “A” rated carrier.  Let's break this down.</p>
            <p>We carry one million dollars of coverage on every load with a $5,000.00 deductible.  If there is damage to your shipment amounting to less than $5,000, Premier will investigate and (where appropriate) and settle the claim ourselves.  If there is a claim over $5,000, then the insurance company will investigate and (where appropriate) settle the claim.  If the product can be repaired it must be repaired.  If it cannot be repaired, it will be replaced for up to $1,000,000.00.</p>
            <p>Most shipments do not approach one million in value.  Certainly most individual machines don't.  So why not pay for less insurance - wouldn't $400,000 do the trick?  Sometimes it would, but it's also pretty easy to put 3 machines worth $200,000.00 each on one load, so a half million might not be enough.  By setting the limit at a full million we know we're covered - or more importantly you are.</p>
            <h1>did you know?</h1>
            <p>The length of time to stop an eighteen-wheeler is 40% greater than that of an automobile. Depending on the weight of their load, whether they are bobtailing, road conditions, and other factors. To be sure, it takes a much greater time to stop than an automobile. Trucks only have 10 brakes NOT eighteen. Recently manufactured trucks are now required to have anti-lock brakes.</p>
            <p>You should beware of carriers who only have a couple hundred thousand dollars of cargo insurance.  They are obviously not experts in machinery shipments.  Even though you might only be putting one machine on such a carrier, you don’t know what they might load in addition.  If that load is involved in a major accident you might not be covered. An insurance company can avoid full payment of a claim if they discover the whole load was underinsured.  You should also beware of carriers that limit their coverage to a rate per pound. This kind of policies work great (and cost less) if you’re a carrier that moves a lot of bulldozers, but it won't pay for the value of a machine tool.  Also watch for those, which will only cover the full value if it is written (declared) on the bill of lading.</p>
            <p>Premier carries what is called an “all-risk” policy.  It is the opposite of what is called a “limited peril” policy.  A limited peril policy may only cover certain kinds of losses.  It may for example limit claims to those involving the truck completely over-turning.  There are a lot of things that could damage your cargo without the truck turning over. There are actually some uncovered events even with an “all-risk” policy but they are extremely remote events such as “an act of war”, or “a nuclear explosion.”</p>
            <p>Premier's insurance is with a U.S. based insurance carrier with an “A” rating or higher. All insurance companies are rated according to industry standards. An “A” rated or higher carrier (you can have double A, etc.) is the most financially sound as so is the most able to pay their claims. You should beware of carriers with insurance companies rated lower than a “B” and also beware of insurance companies based outside the United States.</p>
            <p>Good insurance is expensive, but it's part of doing the job right.</p>
            <h1>Other Coverages</h1>
            <p>There are several additional types of insurance policies that we carry. They are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>General Liability - This is for general and miscellaneous claims.</li>
                <li>Auto Liability - This is for property damage or injury caused by our trucks.</li>
                <li>Warehouse Legal Liability - Basically this is cargo insurance for when the product is warehoused.</li>
                <li>Physical Damage Insurance - This covers our tractors and trailer.</li>
                <li>Worker's Compensation - This covers job related injuries to our employees.</li>
            </ul>
