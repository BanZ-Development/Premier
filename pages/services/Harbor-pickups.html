            <p>At our main office in Long Beach, CA we offer a full range of services for the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach.  We can pick up both loose and containerized cargo.  We can unload, de-Van, and store your cargo or ship it to a final destination.  All you have to do is instruct your customs broker to provide us a delivery order and a packing list.  We will then check with the port continually for the cargo to become available, make the necessary appointments, and pick up your cargo before the free time expires. Our warehouse is located within the harbor’s “Overweight Corridor” which allows us to pick up some overweight containers.</p>

            <p>Premier can also pick up your shipments from other U.S. ports.  We frequently pick up at the ports of NJ/ NY, Baltimore MD, Norfolk VA, Charleston SC, and Savannah GA</p>

                    <p>What is a fuel surcharge and how is it calculated? <i id="faqIcon" class="fa-solid fa-chevron-down"></i></p>
                    <div id="faqAns">
                        <p><b>Fuel is one of the major expenses associated with getting your shipment from point A to point B.</b> When the price of fuel goes up significantly a carrier has to charge more to maintain their operating margins. If there is some question as to when fuel prices will stabilize, carriers will add a fuel surcharge to their base rate. When fuel prices stabilize a carrier may eventually raise their base price and eliminate the fuel surcharge. Most trucks pulling our kinds of trailers and loads may only get about 5 miles per gallon.  So a 2000-mile trip from Los Angeles to Chicago will require about 400 gallons. When fuel is $4.00 per gallon this trip can cost $1600 in fuel alone.</p>

                    <p>Is there restrictions on when you can move oversized loads? <i id="faqIcon" class="fa-solid fa-chevron-down"></i></p>
                    <div id="faqAns">
                        <p><b>Yes.</b>There are a number of things that impact the delivery times of oversize shipments. The restrictions can vary from state to state. Generally the larger the oversize shipment, the more restrictions there will be. The restrictions for a load 10′ wide are different from one that is 12′ feet wide or 14′ wide. Some states want you to only move during the day and in some places you can only move at night. There are often restrictions in and around large cities during peak traffic hours. The rules can vary from Federal highways to State highways. Weather can also have affect oversize loads as can the length of the days. Weekends and holidays can carry varying restrictions as well. Our staff is familiar with these restrictions and will take these factors into account in quoting you a realistic delivery schedule.</p>

                    <p>Why do some carriers or brokers have lower prices? <i id="faqIcon" class="fa-solid fa-chevron-down"></i></p>
                    <div id="faqAns">
                        <p><b>There could be many reasons.</b> They may have less (and less expensive) insurance coverage. They may pay their drivers less. In some cases they may be sacrificing their profit margin in order to make sure they get their truck moved. Sometimes a very large carrier with hundreds of trucks can operate profitably on smaller margins, but these carriers will be more challenged to provide consistent driver quality. Sometimes carriers set their prices too low without even realizing that they are going broke. Hundreds go out of business every year. At Premier we believe we are the right size and have the right price structure to offer consistent, high quality service for those customers who need that.</p>

                    <p>What determines your pricing? <i id="faqIcon" class="fa-solid fa-chevron-down"></i></p>
                    <div id="faqAns">
                        <p>We know what it will take to get a quality driver to take a certain size shipment for a certain number of miles to its destination. We take that dollar amount and add a percentage mark-up to it. Most of each dollar of freight will go to the truck for fuel, equipment and driver wage. The rest of that dollar stays with the company for insurance, phones, facilities, support staff and a modest profit.7</p>
