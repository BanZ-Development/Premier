            <p>There are three keys to great tarping. First, you need a management team that understands the importance of proper tarping and is willing to make sure it’s done right. Second, you need drivers who also understand that importance and who are compensated enough to do the hard work required. Third, you need drivers and owner-operators who have enough of the right tarps and padding. You can’t properly wrap a present with wrapping paper that’s way too big or way too small. Our trucks carry a wide variety of tarps so they have the right tarp for your shipment.</p>

            <p>Bobtailing is the term used when a truck is driving WITHOUT the trailer attached. This is very dangerous especially in wet weather but obviously must be done at times.</p>

                    <p>Are there restrictions on when you can move oversized loads? <i id="faqIcon" class="fa-solid fa-chevron-down"></i></p>
                    <div id="faqAns">
                        <p><b>Yes.</b> There are a number of things that impact the delivery times of oversize shipments. The restrictions can vary from state to state. Generally the larger the oversize shipment, the more restrictions there will be. The restrictions for a load 10' wide are different from one that is 12' feet wide or 14' wide. Some states want you to only move during the day and in some places you can only move at night. There are often restrictions in and around large cities during peak traffic hours. The rules can vary from Federal highways to State highways. Weather can also have affect oversize loads as can the length of the days. Weekends and holidays can carry varying restrictions as well. Our staff is familiar with these restrictions and will take these factors into account in quoting you a realistic delivery schedule.</p>

                    <p>Why do some carriers or broker have lower prices? <i id="faqIcon" class="fa-solid fa-chevron-down"></i></p>
                    <div id="faqAns">
                        <p><b>There could be many reasons.</b> They may have less (and less expensive) insurance coverage. They may pay their drivers less. In some cases they may be sacrificing their profit margin in order to make sure they get their truck moved. Sometimes a very large carrier with hundreds of trucks can operate profitably on smaller margins, but these carriers will be more challenged to provide consistent driver quality. Sometimes carriers set their prices too low without even realizing that they are going broke. Hundreds go out of business every year. At Premier we believe we are the right size and have the right price structure to offer consistent, high quality service for those customers who need that.</p>

                    <p>What determines your pricing? <i id="faqIcon" class="fa-solid fa-chevron-down"></i></p>
                    <div id="faqAns">
                        <p>We know what it will take to get a quality driver to take a certain size shipment for a certain number of miles to its destination. We take that dollar amount and add a percentage mark-up to it. Most of each dollar of freight will go to the truck for fuel, equipment and driver wage. The rest of that dollar stays with the company for insurance, phones, facilities, support staff and a modest profit.</p>
